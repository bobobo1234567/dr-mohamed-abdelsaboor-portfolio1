                  I am Dr. Mohamed Abdelsaboor, a Pediatric Cardiology Consultant at the Magdi Yacoub Heart Foundation in Aswan, Egypt, with over 15 years of experience in diagnosing and treating congenital and acquired heart diseases in children.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After completing my medical education at Cairo University, I pursued specialized training in pediatric cardiology, including a prestigious fellowship at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. This international experience has equipped me with advanced skills in cardiac imaging, interventional procedures, and management of complex cardiac conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My clinical practice focuses on a patient-centered approach, combining medical expertise with compassionate care. I believe in treating not just the heart condition, but supporting the overall wellbeing of the child and providing guidance to families navigating the challenges of pediatric heart disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond clinical work, I am actively involved in research and education. I have published numerous papers in peer-reviewed journals and regularly participate in international conferences to stay at the forefront of advances in pediatric cardiology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My mission is to improve the lives of children with heart disease through excellent clinical care, advancement of knowledge through research, and training the next generation of pediatric cardiologists.
